# Django_for_APIs_Book
This repo contains my code exercises from the book Django for APIs by William S. Vincent. The book teaches how to build web APIs with Django and Django REST Framework.

## Projects
The repo consists of several projects that demonstrate different aspects of building APIs with Django. The projects are:

- *Library API:* A basic CRUD API for books and authors.
- *Todo API:* An API with user authentication and permissions for todo items.
- *Blog API:* An API with custom user model, token authentication and image uploads for blog posts and comments.
- *Chat API:* An API with WebSocket support for real-time chat messages.
